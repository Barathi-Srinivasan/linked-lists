### Architecture Overview

**Architecture Overview**

The `singly_linked_list` project is structured into several key components:

1. **`linkedlist` Class**: The base class providing the abstract interface for all linked list operations.
2. **`singly_linked_list` Class**: Inherits from `linkedlist` and implements a singly linked list with various functionalities.
3. **`node` Struct**: Represents an element in the list, containing a value and a pointer to the next node.

**Key Components:**

- **`node`**: A struct that stores the value and a pointer to the next node in the list.
- **`singly_linked_list`**: Implements methods for list manipulation such as `append`, `prepend`, `insert`, `remove`, and more. It also provides sorting and merging functionalities.

**Design Considerations:**

- **Memory Management**: Manual memory management is used for node allocation and deallocation.
- **Performance**: Operations like sorting and merging are optimized using efficient algorithms.
